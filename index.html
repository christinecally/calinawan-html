      Hi, I’m Christine Mae Calinawan! Welcome to my first web page.
      Here, you’ll get to know more about me.  I’m a first-year IT student at 
      ICCT College in Antipolo.  I’m really excited about this subject
      because it gives me the opportunity to learn coding and explore 
      more about the field of Information Technology. My first course was Electrical Engineering,
      but unfortunately I didn’t pass Calculus. Fortunately, I discovered my interest in Information Technology.
      Lately, I’ve been spending a lot of time using my PC and phone, which made me more interested in the IT field.
      I want to learn programming languages like Python or JavaScript because I enjoy creating things through coding.
